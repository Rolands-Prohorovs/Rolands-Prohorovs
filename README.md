## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  **My name is Rolands Prohorovs, and Iâ€™m from Latvia. Iâ€™ve just started studying at LAB University of Applied Sciences, where Iâ€™m learning programming. Iâ€™ll be using this account to save codes from my studies. Previously, I have been learning programming since 10 grade. In 10th grade I have been tought programming language Java, then in 11th grade I was learning  HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Phyton. I remember only basics from this languages but I am sure I will learn them perfectly in future. In 12th grade I learned php language. I remember some basics about it, I did some projects with it and now I use them to refresh my memory about this language.
